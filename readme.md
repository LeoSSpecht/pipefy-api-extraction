## What is this?
This script was created while working at CoemJr, in 2020, a junior company in Brazil.

It is a Google Scripts that automates the extraction of data to generate metric from Pipefy, a project management tool used by us at the time!

It is highly customizable based on which columns and features the team wanted to extract, just plug it in the spreadsheet it was connected to and it would work.

#### By using it we saved several hours and were able to measure with precision our sales efforts and where we could go with it.

#### Later I set up this script to be ran for more than 5 different companies to also help them save time.
